## Preface

_The terms "software engineering" and "programming" have been used interchangeably over the years, although they have different implications. 
As software engineering isn't currently as rigorous as other areas of engineering, more tedious methods of engineering will be necessary as 
software becomes more commonly integrated into our lives. Software engineering can be referred to as "programming integrated over time", whereas 
we focus on not only writing the code itself, but the tools and processes needed to achieve and maintain sustainable code. Within these
processes, three main topics are of importance: "time and change", "scale and growth", and "trade-offs and costs"._

## What is Software Engineering?

_Software engineers must concern themselves with the need for change as time passes, unlike typical engineers. Furthermore, there exists issues
of scale and efficiency, and outcomes with high stakes after making complex software decisions. Distinctions between "software engineering" and 
"programming" are very important, as the life span of given code allows for a prediction of its sustainability, or how much change will have to 
be implemented to the program's dependencies. Capability is important when deciding whether or not to implement change. You also must consider
the scale of the project, especially since software engineering is typically a team effort. Although team projects can pose new problems, there's
more potential in discovering viable solutions. Trade-offs must be evaluated often, as some implementations come with higher stakes than others.
The level of broader change necessary to a program is dependent on both the amount of programmers working on a project, and their levels of skill 
in programming. Projects must also be adjusted to changing externalities, such as upgrades to programs, depending on the value and necessity of the
given upgrade. Factors such as expertise, stability, conformity, familiarity, and policy can affect a codebase's flexibility. Some costs involved 
within trade-offs include financial, resource, personnel, transaction, opportunity, and societal costs. It's important to be evidence-driven rather
than making assumptions when debating trade-offs and the risks associated within._
