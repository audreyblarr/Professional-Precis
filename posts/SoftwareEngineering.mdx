## Preface

_The terms "software engineering" and "programming" have been used interchangeably over the years, although they have different implications. 
As software engineering isn't currently as rigorous as other areas of engineering, more tedious methods of engineering will be necessary as 
software becomes more commonly integrated into our lives. Software engineering can be referred to as "programming integrated over time", whereas 
we focus on not only writing the code itself, but the tools and processes needed to achieve and maintain sustainable code. Within these
processes, three main topics are of importance: "time and change", "scale and growth", and "trade-offs and costs"._

## What is Software Engineering?

_Software engineers must concern themselves with the need for change as time passes, unlike typical engineers. Furthermore, there exists issues
of scale and efficiency, and outcomes with high stakes after making complex software decisions. Distinctions between "software engineering" and 
"programming" are very important, as the life span of given code allows for a prediction of its sustainability, or how much change will have to 
be implemented to the program's dependencies. Capability is important when deciding whether or not to implement change. You also must consider
the scale of the project, especially since software engineering is typically a team effort. Although team projects can pose new problems, there's
more potential in discovering viable solutions. Trade-offs must be evaluated often, as some implementations come with higher stakes than others.
The level of broader change necessary to a program is dependent on both the amount of programmers working on a project, and their levels of skill 
in programming. Projects must also be adjusted to changing externalities, such as upgrades to programs, depending on the value and necessity of the
given upgrade. Factors such as expertise, stability, conformity, familiarity, and policy can affect a codebase's flexibility. Some costs involved 
within trade-offs include financial, resource, personnel, transaction, opportunity, and societal costs. It's important to be evidence-driven rather
than making assumptions when debating trade-offs and the risks associated within._

## How to Work Well on Teams

_Cultural and social aspects of software engineering are crucial, as it's a team endeavor. A huge issue in the software engineering world includes 
insecurity, as people are afraid of others viewing their unfinished work or criticizing their completed work. A phenomenon known as The Genius Myth 
is exhibited by many in the software engineering industry as we idolize individuals such as Linus Torvalds and attest them as the single-handed creators
of large programs such as Linux. Although sparking the invention himself, Linus shared his implementations and discoveries with several others, allowing
for collaboration and new perspectives on debugging. The program is now a hundred times larger than its original kernal, and is being worked on by thousands. 
The Genius Myth emerges because we strive to imitate these big-name creators rather than ulitizing the resources of collaboration in fear of being critcized 
for not being a 'genius'. Hiding your code is super harmful, as you may not know if you're on the right track. It's easy to make fundamental mistakes early on,
and collaborating allows you to increase the Bus Factor of your code. If you, the sole creator of a program, were to hypothetically get hit by a bus, there would
be nothing stopping your project from failing to be implemented. Working with others is also much faster, and it's much better to be a component of a successful 
program as opposed to the crucial part of a failed one. Working in a team allows for an instantaneous feedback loop so you know when to correct your plans or 
designs. The 'three pillars' of social skills and success include 'humility', 'respect', and 'trust', and creating relationships through these skills allow for richer 
relationships with coworkers and an increased ability to complete the project. Properly documenting any failures within a project can prevent history from repeating 
itself and boost the understandings of others._
