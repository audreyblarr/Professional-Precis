## Preface

_The terms "software engineering" and "programming" have been used interchangeably over the years, although they have different implications. 
As software engineering isn't currently as rigorous as other areas of engineering, more tedious methods of engineering will be necessary as 
software becomes more commonly integrated into our lives. Software engineering can be referred to as "programming integrated over time", whereas 
we focus on not only writing the code itself, but the tools and processes needed to achieve and maintain sustainable code. Within these
processes, three main topics are of importance: "time and change", "scale and growth", and "trade-offs and costs"._
