## Chapter One

_It's essential to create testing for your implemented software to ensure its accuracy. Simple examples of software testing 
may include calculations such as square-root testing, where you can incorporate Python control structures (while, if), assignments,
and comparisons (!=, >, <, etc.). Definitions, unless overwritten, are kept across all executions, and executing one cell will not 
execute the others. You can also incorporate 'print' statements into testing to observe how the function is being implemented. For 
instances such as the square root example, you can test its accuracy by working backwards and multiplying the answer to itself.
However, it's more efficient to use automated testing, where you log the accurate answer and test the function to see if the 
output matches the accurate answer. The 'assert' keyword can also be used, which returns nothing if the function's output matches 
the desired answer, and raises an error if not. You can use an 'epsilon' value to ensure your function's output remains below that 
specific value, which gets rid of any rounding inaccuracies. These tests can be incorporated straight into the implementation as well 
to save space and time. However, you must be able to both formulate and afford these run-time checks. It's also important to remember
you can only test a finite amount of inputs, so there's a limit to the testing in that regard._
