## Chapter One

_It's essential to create testing for your implemented software to ensure accuracy. Simple examples of software testing 
may include calculations like square-root testing, where you can incorporate Python control structures (while, if), assignments,
and comparisons. You can incorporate 'print' statements into testing to observe closely how the function is being implemented. For 
instances like the square root example, you can test its accuracy by working backwards and multiplying the answer to itself.
However, it's more efficient to use automated testing, where you log the accurate answer and test the function to see if the 
output matches the desired answer. The 'assert' keyword can be used, which returns nothing if the function's output matches and raises an error if not.
You can use an 'epsilon' value to ensure your function's output remains below a specified value, which gets rid of any rounding inaccuracies. These tests 
can be incorporated straight into the implementation as well to save space and time. However, you must be able to both formulate and afford these run-time
checks. You can only test a finite amount of inputs, so there's a limit to the testing in that regard._

## Chapter Two

_The term "code coverage" refers to the ability to measure which parts of a program are being executed during a given test run, a process crucial for 
attempting to cover as much code as possible using a test generator. A simple Python command, 'cgi_decode()', will allow you to take an encoded string 
and decode it to its original form. You can derive tests using either Black-box testing, testing for specification, or White-box testing, testing for
implementation. White-box testing covers the structural features of a code, such as statement coverage and branch coverage. Furthermore, this method of 
testing keeps track of which code was executed so a programmer can then focus on writing tests to cover the uncovered code. Dynamic analysis can take 
place using the command 'sys.settrace()'to track how execution proceeds while decoding. Defining a 'Coverage' object to not only keep track of which 
lines are executed, but the function names as well, which is helpful when a program spans over many files. Along with Python, most other coding languages
have their own methods of testing code coverage. We must also set up a results checker to ensure that 'cgi_decode()' is error-free._
