## Chapter One

_It's essential to create testing for your implemented software to ensure accuracy. Simple examples of software testing 
may include calculations like square-root testing, where you can incorporate Python control structures (while, if), assignments,
and comparisons. You can incorporate 'print' statements into testing to observe closely how the function is being implemented. For 
instances like the square root example, you can test its accuracy by working backwards and multiplying the answer to itself.
However, it's more efficient to use automated testing, where you log the accurate answer and test the function to see if the 
output matches the desired answer. The 'assert' keyword can be used, which returns nothing if the function's output matches and raises an error if not.
You can use an 'epsilon' value to ensure your function's output remains below a specified value, which gets rid of any rounding inaccuracies. These tests 
can be incorporated straight into the implementation as well to save space and time. However, you must be able to both formulate and afford these run-time
checks. You can only test a finite amount of inputs, so there's a limit to the testing in that regard._
